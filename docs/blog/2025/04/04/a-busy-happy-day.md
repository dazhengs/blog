# A Busy but Happy Day


This morning, I got up at 6 o'clock. I cooked porridge and transferred some downloaded child-friendly documentaries to our family SMB server, so my kids and I could watch them together later.

After that, I updated the VitePress theme to make writing my blog more efficient.

I went out to buy some KFC and coffee for my wife, since she doesn’t eat porridge.

Later, I replaced the cabin air filter by myself, which saved me 1,000 yuan. It took me two hours to finish because it was my first time doing it — but I think it was worth it.

I also made lunch myself. I accidentally added too much salt and felt a bit salty, but I’ve always believed that cooking my own food is healthier and safer. Food safety is a serious issue in China.

In the afternoon, I played badminton with my son for an hour. It was really fun and even attracted some neighbors to watch.

Then we watched a BBC children’s documentary about life in Antarctica.

Now I’m writing this blog while my son is resting (he's asleep). Although it’s been a busy day, it’s also been full and enjoyable.  
Thank God I lived another day.
