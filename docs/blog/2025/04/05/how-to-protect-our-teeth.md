# How to Protect Your Teeth?

This afternoon, I visited the dentist for periodontal treatment.

After comparing CT scans of healthy teeth and mine, the dentist told me that my periodontitis is quite severe. If I don’t take action, I could lose many teeth.

Following the doctor’s advice, I underwent periodontal scaling. Although I was given anesthesia, I still felt a bit of soreness. The treatment cost me a total of 1,666 yuan.

At the end of the appointment, the nurse explained the post-treatment precautions and taught me how to use dental floss properly.

When I was leaving the hospital, I asked the front desk staff whether Suzhou Stomatological Hospital is the best dental hospital in Suzhou. She smiled and said she didn’t know.

After returning home, I took a rest and then watched a BBC documentary with my son.

The best part of today was teaching my son how to calculate 1 + 2 + 3 + … + 10,000, even though he’s just a first grader in elementary school!

## How to Protect Our Teeth

In the early stages of dental inflammation, there are usually no symptoms. 	If you wait until your teeth start hurting, you’re already late to the party. The damage is probably done by then. Therefore, the first and most important point is to visit the dentist regularly for check-ups.

In daily life, we should make it a habit to brush our teeth after meals, floss correctly, remove food debris between teeth promptly, and have a professional dental cleaning at least once a year.

That’s all for today!
