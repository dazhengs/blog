## Never lose your temper with your child 

I’m working on it.

This morning, I got up at 5:30 AM to cook breakfast for my son, as he needs to be at school by 8:10 AM. I don't want him to be late.

Last time, I got very angry because he did things so slowly, and as a result, he was late for class. I've read The Courage to Be Disliked before, and I realized my outburst was a mistake — it may have left a shadow on my child's heart.

This time, he still ate breakfast slowly, though it was better than last time. And I knew I shouldn't get angry with him, because I had done my part (what I was supposed to do). If he didn’t do his part, then he would have to take responsibility — the responsibility for being late.

So I let it go and calmly reminded him that if he didn’t hurry up, he would definitely be late.

## Life is Movement

This afternoon, I played football with some kids, including mine. I had a great time with these kids; I felt the beauty of life, the power of youth, and the dopamine rush from the exercise. I took some photos, and the smiles on the children’s faces were truly joyful.

I saw a BBC documentary recently that reminded me how hard life can be, how nature is full of competition — even between mother and daughter. The playful moments between parents and their young are so precious — and it’s the same for us humans. Children grow up so quickly and eventually leave us to explore their own world.

Whenever possible, I want to make time each day to exercise with my child — whether it’s running, biking, swimming, hiking, or anything else active. These are moments worth cherishing. The most precious times in life are often found in those beautiful moments of shared activity and connection.
