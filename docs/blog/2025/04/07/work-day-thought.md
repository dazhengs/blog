# Focus is a Scarce Resource

The most important thing I have is my attention. I’ve realized that it’s easily hijacked by trivial matters, which leads to low productivity.

WeChat is the main culprit. Whenever I open the desktop version, I get drawn in by clickbait titles from official accounts and eye-catching covers from video accounts. A few minutes later, I completely forget what I originally intended to do.

Next time, I’ll try to reduce how often I use WeChat — and bring back the Pomodoro timer.

Today, my son and I went swimming. He met up with two of his swimming buddies.


Global stock markets plunged today. I can't help but feel that the Trump administration is like a makeshift team — one of his top advisors has a PhD but seems to lack basic economic understanding.
