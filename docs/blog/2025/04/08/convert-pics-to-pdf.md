# Convert multiple pictures into a single PDF

Today, I completed two tasks.

The first was fixing my Python Playwright scripts to address an issue where videos wouldn’t autoplay. Now, the scripts can automatically play videos on [https://htlj.21tb.com](https://htlj.21tb.com) without requiring a click, saving users a lot of time.

The second task was adding a new feature to my tools: converting multiple pictures into a single PDF.

The website for my tools is [https://tools.dazheng.site](https://tools.dazheng.site). It’s open-source, and the GitHub repository is [https://github.com/dazhengs/tools](https://github.com/dazhengs/tools).
