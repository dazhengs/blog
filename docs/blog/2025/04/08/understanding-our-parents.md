# Parents Are Also New to This World

In recent years, more and more young people have taken to social media to share stories about their upbringing — about growing up in households where they felt controlled, criticized, emotionally neglected, misunderstood, and silenced.

> “My parents never praised me, only put me down.”  
> “I got a 90 on my test, and all they asked was where the other 10 points went.”

These stories resonate deeply with many. Some feel seen, others feel anger and resentment, and some stay silent — especially now that they themselves have become parents, overwhelmed by a mix of emotions.

Those who carry childhood wounds often say they’ve become people-pleasers, socially anxious, or emotionally insecure. Their pain is real. Their sadness is not imagined. This generation is starting to awaken — to heal, and to say, *"I don’t want to pass this on to my children."*

But behind these voices are others who remain quiet.  
They wear worn-out clothes, bargain at the morning market, count out coins carefully on the bus, and hesitate for minutes over a few dollars on a food delivery app.

They are our parents.

What many forget is that on the night we were born, the man pacing nervously in the hospital hallway, rubbing his hands in worry — that was Dad.  
And the pale-faced woman, fresh from stitches yet still trying to feed us our first drop of milk — that was Mom.

They too were once in their twenties, stumbling through the unfamiliar role of being “parents.” No one ever taught them how to be good fathers or mothers. So they did the only thing they could — they figured it out as they went, while carrying the weight of raising a child.

They weren’t experts. They didn’t study psychology. They didn’t learn about “non-violent communication” or “emotional support.”  
They just knew: if the child is hungry, feed them; if they cry, soothe them; if they’re sick, drop everything and run to the hospital.

They worked long hours, took on extra shifts, and lived under the crushing pressure of responsibility.  
And when they lost their temper and said harsh things or even raised a hand — it wasn’t because they didn’t love us. It was because their love was clumsy, unpolished, and sometimes... painfully imperfect.

When we were hurt, they were hurting too.

They were never superheroes. They were — and still are — ordinary people, with their own anxieties, frustrations, and fears.  
While trying to be our parents, they were also worrying about bills, juggling work, and shouldering the burdens of life. They never had the luxury of self-improvement. Life didn’t give them that kind of time or space.

We say they never understood us — but have we ever wondered if they were ever understood?  
Their own childhoods may have been just as bruised, but they never had a safe place to talk about it.  
They didn’t grow up watching bite-sized therapy videos on social media or scrolling through posts that echo their pain. All they knew was to grit their teeth and keep going — for us.

If we are healing our childhood wounds, perhaps they too are still fumbling their way through healing — only they started later and move more slowly.

So what does it really mean to grow up?

It means we begin to recognize our own scars — and gain the courage to see others’ struggles too.  
It means we can say, “I was hurt as a child,” and also say, “I know you did your best.”  
We have every right to mourn our childhood, and still shed tears for the hardships our parents endured.

Our generation is luckier.  
We have access to better resources, a more open environment, and a stronger sense of self-awareness.

May we all learn to let go through understanding, and grow through compassion.
