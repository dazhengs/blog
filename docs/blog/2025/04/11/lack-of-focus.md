# The Reason for Low Efficiency is Lack of Focus

Today I found myself struggling with low productivity. After some reflection, I realized the root cause was my inability to maintain focus.

I kept switching between different tasks - checking emails, browsing social media, responding to messages, and trying to code all at the same time. This constant context switching was destroying my ability to concentrate deeply on any single task.

Research shows that it takes around 23 minutes to fully regain focus after an interruption. By frequently switching tasks, I was never giving my brain enough time to get into a proper flow state.

Some key lessons I learned:

1. Block out dedicated focus time - Set aside chunks of time (1-2 hours) for focused work with no distractions
2. Turn off notifications - Disable email, chat and phone notifications during focus periods
3. Use the Pomodoro Technique - Work in 25 minute focused sprints followed by short breaks
4. Have a clear priority - Know exactly what task you need to focus on before starting
5. Create a distraction-free environment - Find a quiet space and close unnecessary browser tabs

Going forward, I'm committed to practicing better focus habits. The ability to concentrate deeply is like a muscle - it gets stronger with consistent training.

True productivity doesn't come from multitasking, but from giving our complete attention to what matters most.
