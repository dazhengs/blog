# Nobody Likes Being Sold to

After my son's class ended, his teacher asked me to stay behind to talk about the summer camp.

A few weeks earlier, my son told me he didn't want to go to the summer camp organized by the Wushu school. For the sake of my son's teacher, I patiently listened to the supervisor's introduction of the summer camp. At the end, I said that I would tell him when we decided to go. He said that today was the last day to determine, and repeated many times that this was the last chance to decide to participate in it.

I remembered what Musk said: "Marketing is selling bad products to people who don't need them." I felt like he was trying to sell me something.

On the way home, I asked my son if he would like to attend that summer camp. He said he didn't know. I said, "This summer camp is actually 5 days of military training plus 2 days of travel. The cost is 7000 RMB. If it were me, I would definitely not go. It's just a waste of money." He said he would not go.
