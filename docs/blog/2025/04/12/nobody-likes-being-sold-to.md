# Nobody Likes Being Sold to

After my son's class ended, his teacher asked me to stay behind to talk about the summer camp. I could tell from his expression that this wasn't going to be a casual conversation.

A few weeks earlier, my son told me he didn't want to go to the summer camp organized by the Wushu school. He had been taking Wushu classes for about a year, and while he enjoyed the regular sessions, he wasn't enthusiastic about an intensive summer program. For the sake of my son's teacher, I patiently listened to the supervisor's introduction of the summer camp. He spoke at length about character building, discipline development, and the unique experiences the children would have. At the end, I politely said that I would tell him when we decided to go. His demeanor immediately changed as he said that today was the last day to determine, and repeated many times that this was the last chance to decide to participate in it.

The high-pressure sales tactics made me uncomfortable. I remembered what Musk said: "Marketing is selling bad products to people who don't need them." I felt like he was trying to sell me something that neither my son nor I wanted. The urgency felt artificial - a classic sales technique to force quick decisions without proper consideration.

On the way home, I asked my son if he would like to attend that summer camp. He said he didn't know, his voice uncertain. I decided to break down the offer objectively: "This summer camp is actually 5 days of military training plus 2 days of travel. The cost is 7000 RMB. If it were me, I would definitely not go. It's just a waste of money. That's almost 1000 RMB per day for activities you're not even excited about." He seemed relieved when I put it that way and firmly said he would not go.

The experience reminded me how important it is to teach children about making informed decisions and not giving in to pressure tactics. Sometimes saying "no" is the best decision, especially when someone is trying too hard to make you say "yes."
