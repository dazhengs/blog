# How to Make DNS Queries More Secure

In today’s digital world, securing your online activities is critical, even for tasks as routine as browsing the web. DNS (Domain Name System) queries, which translate website names like "example.com" into IP addresses, are a fundamental part of internet usage. However, these queries can be vulnerable to interception, manipulation, or tracking, potentially exposing your data or leading you to malicious sites. For white-collar workers who rely on secure internet access for emails, client communications, and sensitive transactions, protecting DNS queries is a simple yet powerful step toward better cybersecurity.

This article outlines easy methods to enhance DNS security on Windows, macOS, and iOS devices, tailored for professionals who want straightforward solutions without technical complexity.

## Why DNS Security Matters

Unsecured DNS queries can be intercepted by hackers or ISPs, allowing them to track your browsing habits or redirect you to fraudulent websites. Secure DNS methods encrypt these queries, safeguarding your privacy and ensuring you reach legitimate sites. The good news? Modern operating systems make it easy to implement these protections with minimal effort.

## Securing DNS Queries on Windows

Windows powers most workplace PCs, offering a familiar interface for professionals managing spreadsheets, presentations, or client calls. To secure DNS queries on Windows 11 (the latest version as of April 2025), you can enable DNS over HTTPS (DoH), which encrypts DNS traffic for enhanced privacy.

### Steps:

1. **Open Settings**: Click the Start menu and select "Settings" (gear icon).
2. **Navigate to Network Settings**: Go to "Network & Internet" &gt; "Wi-Fi" or "Ethernet" (depending on your connection).
3. **Edit DNS Settings**: Select your active network, click "Hardware properties," and find the "DNS server assignment" section. Click "Edit."
4. **Choose Encrypted DNS**: Select "Manual," enable IPv4, and set the "Preferred DNS" to a secure provider like Cloudflare (1.1.1.1) or Google (8.8.8.8). Under "DNS encryption," choose "Encrypted only (DNS over HTTPS)."
5. **Save Changes**: Click "Save," and your DNS queries will now be encrypted.

**Why It’s Simple**: This built-in feature requires no software downloads or technical expertise, taking just a few clicks to activate. Cloudflare and Google are trusted providers, ensuring reliability for work-related browsing.

## Securing DNS Queries on macOS

macOS, commonly used on MacBooks and iMacs, is popular among professionals in creative and tech industries for its sleek design and productivity tools. macOS Ventura (and later) supports encrypted DNS, making it easy to secure queries without third-party apps.

### Steps:

1. **Open System Settings**: Click the Apple menu (top-left corner) and select "System Settings."
2. **Go to Network Settings**: Click "Network" in the sidebar, then select your active connection (e.g., Wi-Fi).
3. **Configure DNS**: Click "Details" next to your network, then select the "DNS" tab. Click the "+" button to add a DNS server.
4. **Add Secure DNS Provider**: Enter a secure DNS address, such as Cloudflare (1.1.1.1) or Quad9 (9.9.9.9). For encryption, visit [https://github.com/paulmillr/encrypted-dns](https://github.com/paulmillr/encrypted-dns) for more information.

5. **Apply Changes**: Click "OK" and "Apply" to save.

**Optional for Full DoH**: Some macOS versions may not natively support DoH without a configuration profile. Visit Cloudflare’s 1.1.1.1 website (https://1.1.1.1) on your Mac, download their macOS app. This ensures full encryption.

**Why It’s Simple**: macOS’s native settings are intuitive, and trusted DNS providers like Quad9 offer malware-blocking features, ideal for professionals accessing client portals or financial sites.

## Securing DNS Queries on iOS

iOS powers iPhones and iPads, essential tools for professionals checking emails, joining virtual meetings, or managing tasks on the go. iOS 18 (the latest as of April 2025) supports encrypted DNS through simple Wi-Fi settings or a configuration profile.

### Steps:

1. **Open Settings**: Tap the "Settings" app on your iPhone or iPad.
2. **Go to Wi-Fi**: Tap "Wi-Fi" and select your connected network (tap the "i" icon next to it).
3. **Set DNS**: Scroll to the "DNS" section, select "Manual," and remove existing DNS servers. Add a secure provider like Cloudflare (1.1.1.1 and 1.0.0.1) or Google (8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4).
4. **Enable Encrypted DNS (Optional)**: For full DoH, visit https://1.1.1.1 on Safari, download Cloudflare’s iOS app, and install and start it .

**Why It’s Simple**: iOS’s Wi-Fi settings are user-friendly, and the optional profile installation is a quick tap-and-go process. This setup ensures secure browsing during client calls or when accessing work apps on public Wi-Fi.

## Additional Tips for Professionals

- **Use Trusted DNS Providers**: Stick to reputable services like Cloudflare (1.1.1.1), Google (8.8.8.8), or Quad9 (9.9.9.9). These providers prioritize privacy and often block malicious sites, protecting your work data.
- 
- **Enable on All Devices**: Apply these settings across your work PC, laptop, and phone to maintain consistent security, especially when switching between office and remote work.
- **Check with IT**: If you’re on a corporate network, consult your IT team before changing DNS settings, as some organizations enforce specific configurations.
- **Update Regularly**: Keep your devices updated to the latest Windows, macOS, or iOS versions, as security patches often enhance DNS protections.

## Conclusion

Securing DNS queries is a quick, effective way to protect your online activities, whether you’re drafting reports on Windows, designing presentations on macOS, or responding to emails on iOS. By enabling DNS over HTTPS with trusted providers, white-collar workers can browse with confidence, knowing their data is shielded from prying eyes. These simple steps, requiring just a few minutes, empower professionals to stay secure without disrupting their workflow.
