Today, I watched the movie King of the Children, directed by Chen Kaige. It left a deep impression on me—not just as a film, but as a quiet, powerful meditation on education, truth, and individuality.

One scene, in particular, stood out. A teacher shared two principles about writing that struck me as simple yet profound.

The first was: write clearly. Even if your writing is plain or unrefined, clarity should come first. It reminded me that the essence of communication isn’t in flowery language, but in whether the reader can understand your thoughts. We often chase eloquence, but forget that the heart of good writing is simply being understood.

The second was: be honest with yourself. Don't write to impress, and don’t censor your thoughts out of fear of being laughed at. That message felt especially relevant today, in a time when so much of what we create—whether in writing or online—is shaped by the fear of judgment. The film's message was a quiet call to courage: write what you really think, even if it’s raw or awkward. There's dignity in that kind of honesty.

Beyond this moment, the film offered a haunting portrayal of rural education during the Cultural Revolution. The classrooms were sparse, the textbooks outdated, and the students innocent but burdened by a system that valued rote learning over critical thinking. It made me reflect on how deeply a political ideology can infiltrate even the smallest corners of a child's life—and how fragile the act of thinking freely becomes under such pressure.

The protagonist, a young teacher sent to a remote village, begins with idealism, but gradually comes to realize the absurdity and limitations of the system he is part of. His journey from compliance to quiet rebellion is subtle but powerful. He chooses to teach not just the curriculum, but thinking itself. That felt revolutionary. It reminded me how real education isn't about filling heads with facts, but igniting minds with questions.

There’s a quiet sadness in the film too—a sense that the most thoughtful, sincere people often face the harshest consequences in rigid systems. But it’s also a film about hope. About how even a single honest voice, in the quietest of places, can make a difference.

King of the Children isn’t loud. It doesn’t shout its message. But it lingers. It made me reflect not just on how we write, but on how we live, learn, and teach—with clarity, honesty, and courage.
