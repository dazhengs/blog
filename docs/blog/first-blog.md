## First, Just Write It in English

I found that English opened a new window for me, and I enjoy it.

I want to learn English by using it. I will be documenting some of the things that made me feel like it was so and it was just so. This includes, but is not limited to, technology sharing, book reviews, and small applications I've developed myself.

OK, let me get started. Thank you for reading.
