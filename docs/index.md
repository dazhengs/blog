 motto: 'just do it'
 inspiring:
  - Life is short. Smile while you still have teeth.
  - Age is merely the number of years the world has been enjoying you. 
  - I used to think I was indecisive, but now I’m not so sure.
  - Why fit in when you were born to stand out?
  - The unexamined life is not worth living.
  - Be yourself; everyone else is already taken.
  - What you do today can improve all your tomorrows.
  - I am an early bird and a night owl… so I am wise and I have worms.
